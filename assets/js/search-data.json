X is a random variable that will take on one of the values:0,1,2 3&gt; represented using a capital vairalbe . Discrete random variables can take on a coutable number of possible values . A finite (or countable infinite) number of possible values . Continuous random variables can take on any value in a given interval . Infinite number of possible values . Examples of discrete: . number of free throws an NBA player makes in next 20 attempts possible values: 0, 1,2...20 . number of rolls of a die needed to roll a 3 fo rthe first time possibel values: 1,2,3 ... any whole num value (countably infiinte number of values) . profit o a $1.5 bet on a black in roulette. possible values: -1.5 or 1.5 (countalbe possible values, can be negative and decimals) . Examples of continuous: . velocity of the next pitch in major league baseball . time between lightning strikes in a thunderstorm . height, weight, length, time . there are some important distinctions between discrete and continuous probability distributions . Probability distribution of a discrete random variable . The probability distribution of a discrete random variable X is a listing of all possible values of X and their probabilities of occuring. . approximately 60% of new born babies develop jaundice. . suppose we sample 2 full-term newborn babies. X represnets the number of babies that developed jaundice. . whats the probability distribution of X? . we can have 0 1 or 2 values for X . possible outcomes: . Outcome JJ JN. NJ NN . value of x: | 2. | 1. | 1. | 0 | . probability: | 0.6*0.6 | 0.6*0.4 | 0.4*0.6 | 0.4*0.4 | . x: 0. 1. 2 . p(x) | 0.16 | 0.48 | 0.36 | . All discrete probability distributions must satisfify these conditions: . all probabilities must lie between 0 and 1 . sum of probabilities must equal 1 . . probability mass function formula: . . there are many other type of common discrete probability distributions. . . Expected value and Variance . expected value (expectation) of a random variable is the theoretical mean of the random variable . E(X) = $ mu$ . calculate expected value of discrete random variable X:E(X) = $ sum$ x.p(x) expecttion of a function g(X): . E[g(X)] = $ sum$ g(x) . p(x) . weight avg of the probability of occuring . variance of X: (expectation of the squared distance of X from its mean) . $ sigma^2$ = E[ (X - $ mu$)$^2$ ] = $ sum$ (x - $ mu$)$^2$ . p(x) . handy relationshp: . E[ (X - $ mu$)$^2$ ] = E[ X$^2$ ] - [E(X)]$^2$ . E[ (X - $ mu$)$^2$ ] = E[ X$^2$ ] - $ mu$$^2$ . Problems: . x: 0. 1. 2 . p(x) | 0.16 | 0.48 | 0.36 | . E(X) = $ sum$ x.p(x) . = 0 0.16 + 1 0.48 + 2 * 0.36 . = 1.2 . if we simulate a million values of X and take average of the values. we get 1.19986 (experimental validation) . Law of large numbers :states that as a sample size grows, its mean gets closer to the average of the whole population . . lets find the expectation of a function of X: x$^2$ . E(X$^2$) = $ sum$ x$^2$ . p(x) . = 1.92 . variance of X? . $ sigma^2$ = $ sum$ (x - $ mu$)$^2$ . p(x) . = (0-1.2)$^2$ 0.16 + (1-1.2)$^2$ 0.48 + (2-1.2)$^2$ * 0.36 . = 0.48 . E[ (X - $ mu$)$^2$ ] = E[ X$^2$ ] - $ mu$$^2$ . = 1.92 - 1.2$^2$ . = 0.48 . . . Bernoulli Distribution . Toss a fair coin once. What is the distribution of the number of heads? . conditions: . single trial . trial results in one of 2 possible outcomes:success/failure Independent, mutually exclusive outcomes (exhaustive also?) . p(success) = p . p(failure) = 1-p . Let X = 1 if a success occurs &amp; X = 0 if a failure occures . Then X has a Bernoulli distriburion: . P(X = x) = p$^x$(1-p)$^1$$^-$$^x$ . for x = 0,1 . this is probability mass function of a bernoulli function . . mean: $ mu$ = p . . variance: $ sigma$$^2$ = p(1-p) . . . Example: . approximately 1 in 200 american adults are lawyers. . one american adult is andomly selected. . what is the distribuion of the number of lawyers? . p(x=1) = 1/200 . p(x=0) = 199/200 . . some other common discrete probability distributions are built on the assumption of independent Bernoulli trials. . Binomial: distribution of number of successes in n independent bernoulli trials | Geometric: distribution of number of trials to get a first success. in independent bernoulli trials | Negative binomial: distribution of number of trials to get the rth success in independent bernoulli trials | Binomial distribution . The number of successes in n independent Bernoulli trails has a binomial distribution . A coin is flipped 100 times. What is the probability heads comes up at least 60 times? . You buy a certain type of lottery ticket once a week for 4 weeks. What is the probability you win a cash prize exactly twice? . conditions: . There are n independent trials. . Each trial can result in either success/failure . P(success) = p and is constant from trial to traial . P(fail) = 1-p . X represents the number of successes in n trials. . Then X has a binomial distribution: . $P(X=x) = {n choose x} p^x (1-p)^{ n-x}$ . for x = 0,1,2,3...n . combinations formula: . ${n choose x} = frac{n!}{x!(n-x)!)}$ . $ mu$ = E(X) = np . . $ sigma$ = np(1-p) . . . Q: A balanced 6 sided die is rolled 3 times. What is the probability a 5 comes up exactly twice? . A: If asked what is a probability a 6 comes up once , 4 comes up once and 3 comes up once. this is not a bernoulli trial. a dice has 6 sides so more than one possibility. read the question carefully . in our question . success : rolling a 5 . failure: rolling any other number . Let X represent number of 5s in 3 rolls . X has a binomial distribution with n=3 and p=1/6 . $P(X=x) = {3 choose 2} ( frac{1}{6})^2 (1- frac{1}{6})^{ 3-2}$ . = 0.0694 . reasoning: . $p^x (1-p)^{ n-x}$ is the probability of one specific ordering of successes and failures. . there are ${n choose x}$ possible orderings . . The probability of a randomly selected 90 years old canadian male survives for another year is aproximately 0.82. . If twenty 90-year old canadian males are randomly selected, what is the probability exactly 18 survive for atleast another year . p = 0.82 . ${20 choose 18} 0.82^{18} (1-0.82)^{20-18}$ . = 0.173 . Bonus: . $ mu$ = np = 20*0.82 = 16.4 . so out of 20 randomly selected sample, on an average 16.4 of them will live for another year. . $ sigma^2$ = np(1-p) = 2.952 . what is the probability that at least 18 survive for a year? . ${20 choose 18} 0.82^{18} (1-0.82)^{20-18}$ + ${20 choose 19} 0.82^{19} (1-0.82)^{20-19}$ + ${20 choose 20} 0.82^{20} (1-0.82)^{20-20}$ . = 0.275 . Binomial / Not Binomial . The probability a randomly selected 40 year old pregnant woman is carrying a fetus with down syndrome is approximately 0.01 . 25 40 uear old pregnant women are randomly selected. What is the probability exactly 2 are carrying a fets with Down syndrome? . YES . X: number of pregnant women carrying a fetus with down syndrome . n: 25 . p: 0.01 . . Suppose an ordinary 6 sided die is rolled 16 times. . What is the probability that on exactly 5 of the rolls, either a 3 or a 4 comes up? . YES . success : 3 or 4 . failure : 1,2,5,6 . Trials are independent . p remains same for all trails . X has binomial distribution. . n = 16, p=2/6 . . A die rolled until a 6 comes up 3 times. . Let X represent the number of the trial on which the 3rd 6 appears. . NO . This is negative binomial distribution . . In a pool of 30 job applicants, 6 have a criminal record. you randomly select 8 from the 30 for an interview. . what is the probability exactly 2 have a criminal record? . NO . first selected candidate has a probability of 6/30 of being criminal second selected candidate has a probability of 5/29. . so the trails are not independent. . this is a Hypergeometric distribution. . . The number of putts a PGA tour player makes in his next 10 putts. . NO . satisfied: . fixed number trials 10 . outcomes are : they make it or miss it . . . . . not satisfied: . p is changing. all putts are not same. some are long some are short etc. . all putts are not independent of one another. if a PGA player misses a putt , that influences the next shot . . Probability that there are exactly 8 lighting strikes in the first 5 minutes of the next thunderstorm? . NO . Not satisfied: . we donot have a fixed number of trials . . Hypergeometric distribution . Suppose we are randomly sampling n objects without replacement from a source that contains &quot;a&quot; successes and &quot;N-a&quot; failures. . random variable X represents the number of successes in the sample. . Then X has the hypergeometric distribution: . . . An urn contains 6 red balls and 14 yellow balls. 5 balls are randomly dawn without replcement. What is the probability exactly 4 red balls are drawn? . trials are not independent. Binomial cannot be applies here. . . If sampling with replacement, using binomial distribution would be appropriate. . P(4 red balls) = ${5 choose 4} (6/20)^4 (1-6/20)^{5-4}$ = 0.02835 . as on any draw, p(red) = 6/20 . . Suppose a large high school has 1100 female and 900 male students. A random sample of 10 students is draws. What is the probability exactly 7 of the selected students are female? . num of objects sampled, n (with replacement doesn&#39;t make sense. without replacement is implied) = 10 num of successes in population, a = 1100 num of failuers in popularion, N-a = 900 . . had we used binomial distribution: . P(X=7) = ${10 choose 7} (0.55)^7 (1-0.55)^{10-7}$ = 0.16648 . Relation between Binomial and Hypergrometric . As you can see we are pretty close to the hypergeometric answer. But in the urn example, we were far away. . Binomial distribution can sometimes provide a reasonable approximation to the hypergeometric. . rought guideline: if we are not sampling more than 5% of the population, the binomial provides a reasonable approximation. . we do this because its easier to work with. after the first female sample in population. with/without sample isn&#39;t that different. . . Suppose a business employs 12 Democrats, 24 republicans and 8 independents. If a random sample of 6 employees is drawn, what is the probability ther are 3 democrats, 2 republicans and 1 independent in the sample? . . so we can extened to more than 2 types of obects. multivariate hypergeometric . Poisson distribution . Suppose we are counting the number of occurances of an event in a given unit of time, dstance, area, or volume. . Then X, the number of events in a fixed unit of time, has a Poisson distribution. . example: . The number of car accidents in a day. . | Number of customers visiting . | . conditions: . events are occuring independently and randomly . | the probability that event occurs in a given length of time doesn&#39;t change through time. . | .",
